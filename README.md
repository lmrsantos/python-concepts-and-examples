# General codes to better understand Python
Here it is possible to see some examples of small codes about how to handle simple things in Python such as list, set and strings and more complex concepts like recursion and decorators. If it is too much and want a break, play a little Wordle - you can see this code in this library as well.

# Libraries
Here are some important libraries that all Python developers should know:

- **NumPy**: NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to manipulate and analyze these arrays efficiently.
- **Pandas**: Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures such as Series (1-dimensional) and DataFrame (2-dimensional) to handle and manipulate data in an easy and efficient way.
- **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a library for data visualization. It provides a variety of charts and plots that can be used to visualize data in a clear and concise way.
- **Scikit-learn**: Scikit-learn is a library for machine learning. It provides a variety of algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.
- **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow is a library for machine learning and deep learning. It provides a flexible framework for building and training machine learning models.
- **PyTorch**: PyTorch is another library for machine learning and deep learning. It is similar to TensorFlow, but it is more lightweight and flexible.
